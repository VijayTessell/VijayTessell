<!-- About me -->
<h3> About Me <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30"> </h3>

I am an analytical thinker with a touch of artistic sense, driven by an insatiable thirst for knowledge and a deep sense of dedication. I approach every task with unwavering commitment and a never-give-up attitude.

My passion for learning and exploration has taught me that while no one knows everything, everyone knows something—and we can always learn from one another.

From my first encounter with C++ in 11th grade to writing thousands of lines of code in a professional setting, my journey has been one of continuous growth.

If you're interested in discussing my journey, competitive exams, emerging technologies, or building innovative products, feel free to DM me. I'd be more than happy to share my insights and experiences.
